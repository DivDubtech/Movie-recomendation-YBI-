# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a simple movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on a user's input. The system leverages TF-IDF vectorization to analyze and compare movie metadata such as genres, keywords, taglines, cast, and directors. The recommendations are provided using cosine similarity scores between movies.

## Features
- Suggest movies similar to a userâ€™s favorite movie.
- Choose between **Top 10** or **Top 30** movie recommendations.
- Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into feature vectors.
- Calculates similarity between movies using cosine similarity.

## Project Structure
- `movie_recommendation.py`: The main Python script that runs the recommendation system.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the project.

## Dataset
